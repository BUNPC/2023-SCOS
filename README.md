# SCOS processing

Communications Biology 2023 - Measuring human cerebral blood flow and brain function with fiber-based speckle contrast optical spectroscopy system

We created a data analysis pipeline for SCOS under photon starved conditions. This repository contains sample images from Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion camera (./sample data), as well as functions and script to run the noise correction pipeline.

To run the code:

1) Download all the files in one folder
2) Run HamamatsuPipeline.m
